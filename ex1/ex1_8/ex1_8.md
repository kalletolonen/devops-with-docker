### Exercise 1.8: Two line Dockerfile

By default our devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine doesn't have a CMD. Instead, it uses ENTRYPOINT to declare which application is run.

We'll talk more about ENTRYPOINT in the next section, but you already know that the last argument in docker run can be used to give a command or an argument.

As you might've noticed it doesn't start the web service even though the name is "simple-web-service". A suitable argument is needed to start the server!

Try docker run devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine hello. The application reads the argument "hello" but will inform that hello isn't accepted.

In this exercise create a Dockerfile and use FROM and CMD to create a brand new image that automatically runs server.

Let's create the Dockerfile:
```Dockerfile
FROM devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine

CMD server
```

And build & run it:

```bash
$ docker build . -t web-server
