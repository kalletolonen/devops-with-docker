### Exercise 1.9: Volumes

In this exercise we won't create a new Dockerfile.

Image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service creates a timestamp every two seconds to /usr/src/app/text.log when it's not given a command. Start the container with a bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem.

Submit the command you used to complete the exercise.

```bash
$ docker run -d -v ${PWD}/text.log:/usr/src/app/text.log devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu

$ cat text.log
